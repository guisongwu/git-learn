test git pull when local repo is not up to date with remote



Note: If on remote repo, you make changes and commit them, then on local repo, if you have local changes that are not committed, when you do git pull, git will try to merge the remote changes with your local changes. If there are conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually. If there are no conflicts, git will automatically merge the changes.
